|[Efficient Joinable Table Discovery in Data Lakes: A High-Dimensional Similarity-Based Approac](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13273)|ICDE 21|joinable table search|The document discusses the problem of finding joinable tables in data lakes and proposes a framework called PEXESO for efficient joinable table discovery. Traditional approaches for finding joinable tables are limited in dealing with misspellings, different formats, and capturing semantic joins. PEXESO addresses these limitations by using high-dimensional vectors to represent textual values and joining columns based on similarity predicates. The framework utilizes a block-and-verify method with pivot-based filtering to efficiently find joinable tables with similarity. It also incorporates a partitioning technique for large data lakes that cannot fit in main memory. Experimental evaluations on real datasets demonstrate that PEXESO identifies more tables than equi-joins and outperforms other similarity-based options, while also improving the performance of machine learning tasks. The proposed method is efficient and achieves significant speedup compared to exact baselines.|
|[Leva: Boosting Machine Learning Performance with Relational Embedding Data Augmentation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3514221.3517891))|SIGMOD 22|joinable table search|The document titled "Leva: Boosting Machine Learning Performance with Relational Embedding Data Augmentation" presents a system called Leva that enhances the performance of machine learning tasks over relational data. Leva constructs a relational embedding by representing relational data as a graph and using embedding methods to represent the graph as vectors. The embedding includes information from the entire database, which improves the performance of downstream machine learning tasks. The document highlights the challenges of feature engineering, data discovery, and integration in building training datasets and discusses the tradeoff between convenience and performance. Leva addresses these challenges by automatically constructing a relational embedding without prior knowledge of table keys or join paths. The document presents the main contributions of Leva, including relational embeddings for boosting ML models, an end-to-end system for generating relational embeddings, and an analysis of why the embedding works. The document concludes with an outline of the paper and references to related work in the field.|
|[DeepJoin: Joinable Table Discovery with Pre-trained Language Models](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/3603581.3603587)|PVLDB 23|joinable table search|The document titled "DeepJoin: Joinable Table Discovery with Pre-trained Language Models" proposes a deep learning model called DeepJoin for accurate and efficient joinable table discovery in data lake management. The model utilizes a pre-trained language model (PLM) to embed columns into vectors and employs an embedding-based retrieval approach to find joinable tables. The PLM is fine-tuned to embed columns in such a way that joinable columns are close to each other in the vector space. The search procedure is independent of the column size, and with the use of an approximate nearest neighbor search algorithm, the search time is sublinear in the repository size. The model is trained using techniques for preparing training data and data augmentation. Experimental results show that DeepJoin outperforms other approximate solutions in terms of precision and is even more accurate than an exact solution for semantic joins. Additionally, DeepJoin is significantly faster when equipped with a GPU. The document also provides a problem definition and preliminary information on equi-joins and semantic joins.|
|[Table Union Search on Open Data.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.14778/3192965.3192973)|PVLDB 18|table union search|presents a solution to the table union search problem, which involves finding tables that can be combined with a query table within large repositories of open data. The authors propose a probabilistic approach that utilizes three statistical models to determine the unionability of attributes: set domains, semantic domains with values from an ontology, and natural language domains. They also introduce a data-driven method for selecting the best model for each attribute pair. The authors evaluate the accuracy of their solution using a benchmark of open data tables and demonstrate that their approach outperforms existing algorithms in terms of speed and accuracy, even when dealing with repositories containing over one million attributes.|
|[Dataset Discovery in Data Lakes](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9101607)|ICDE 20|table union search|discusses the problem of dataset discovery in data lakes and proposes an effective and efficient solution to address it. The authors highlight the increasing availability of datasets in data lakes without explicit knowledge of their conceptual relationships. They define a data lake as a repository of datasets with minimal metadata, such as attribute names and types. The paper focuses on the initial stage of dataset discovery, which involves identifying datasets that are most useful for data wrangling tasks. The authors propose a solution called D3L (Dataset Discovery in Data Lakes) that uses features of the values in a dataset to construct hash-based indexes. These indexes map the features into a uniform distance space, allowing for the measurement of relatedness between features and a target table. The approach considers various types of evidence, including attribute name similarity, attribute extent overlap, word-embedding similarity, format representation similarity, and domain distribution similarity. The authors provide a detailed description of the approach and report empirical results showing significant improvements in precision, recall, target coverage, indexing, and discovery times compared to prior work.|
|[Semantics-aware Dataset Discovery from Data Lakes with Contextualized Column-based Representation Learning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/3587136.3587146)|PVLDB 23|table union search|proposes Starmie, an end-to-end framework for dataset discovery from data lakes, with a focus on table union search. The framework utilizes a contrastive learning method to train column encoders from pre-trained language models, capturing rich contextual semantic information within tables. The cosine similarity between column embedding vectors is used as the column unionability score, and a filter-and-verification framework is proposed to compute the unionability score between two tables. Starmie outperforms existing solutions in the effectiveness of table union search and employs the HNSW index to accelerate query processing. The document highlights the challenges in dataset discovery and the contributions of Starmie in addressing these challenges.|
