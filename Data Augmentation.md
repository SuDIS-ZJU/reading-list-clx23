|[Efficient Joinable Table Discovery in Data Lakes: A High-Dimensional Similarity-Based Approac](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13273)|ICDE 21|joinable table search|The document discusses the problem of finding joinable tables in data lakes and proposes a framework called PEXESO for efficient joinable table discovery. Traditional approaches for finding joinable tables are limited in dealing with misspellings, different formats, and capturing semantic joins. PEXESO addresses these limitations by using high-dimensional vectors to represent textual values and joining columns based on similarity predicates. The framework utilizes a block-and-verify method with pivot-based filtering to efficiently find joinable tables with similarity. It also incorporates a partitioning technique for large data lakes that cannot fit in main memory. Experimental evaluations on real datasets demonstrate that PEXESO identifies more tables than equi-joins and outperforms other similarity-based options, while also improving the performance of machine learning tasks. The proposed method is efficient and achieves significant speedup compared to exact baselines.|
|[Leva: Boosting Machine Learning Performance with Relational Embedding Data Augmentation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3514221.3517891))|SIGMOD 22|joinable table search|The document presents a system called Leva that enhances the performance of machine learning tasks over relational data. Leva constructs a relational embedding by representing relational data as a graph and using embedding methods to represent the graph as vectors. The embedding includes information from the entire database, which improves the performance of downstream machine learning tasks. The document highlights the challenges of feature engineering, data discovery, and integration in building training datasets and discusses the tradeoff between convenience and performance. Leva addresses these challenges by automatically constructing a relational embedding without prior knowledge of table keys or join paths. The document presents the main contributions of Leva, including relational embeddings for boosting ML models, an end-to-end system for generating relational embeddings, and an analysis of why the embedding works. The document concludes with an outline of the paper and references to related work in the field.|
|[DeepJoin: Joinable Table Discovery with Pre-trained Language Models](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/3603581.3603587)|PVLDB 23|joinable table search|The document proposes a deep learning model called DeepJoin for accurate and efficient joinable table discovery in data lake management. The model utilizes a pre-trained language model (PLM) to embed columns into vectors and employs an embedding-based retrieval approach to find joinable tables. The PLM is fine-tuned to embed columns in such a way that joinable columns are close to each other in the vector space. The search procedure is independent of the column size, and with the use of an approximate nearest neighbor search algorithm, the search time is sublinear in the repository size. The model is trained using techniques for preparing training data and data augmentation. Experimental results show that DeepJoin outperforms other approximate solutions in terms of precision and is even more accurate than an exact solution for semantic joins. Additionally, DeepJoin is significantly faster when equipped with a GPU. The document also provides a problem definition and preliminary information on equi-joins and semantic joins.|
|[Table Union Search on Open Data.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.14778/3192965.3192973)|PVLDB 18|table union search|The document presents a solution to the table union search problem, which involves finding tables that can be combined with a query table within large repositories of open data. The authors propose a probabilistic approach that utilizes three statistical models to determine the unionability of attributes: set domains, semantic domains with values from an ontology, and natural language domains. They also introduce a data-driven method for selecting the best model for each attribute pair. The authors evaluate the accuracy of their solution using a benchmark of open data tables and demonstrate that their approach outperforms existing algorithms in terms of speed and accuracy, even when dealing with repositories containing over one million attributes.|
|[Dataset Discovery in Data Lakes](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9101607)|ICDE 20|table union search|The document discusses the problem of dataset discovery in data lakes and proposes an effective and efficient solution to address it. The authors highlight the increasing availability of datasets in data lakes without explicit knowledge of their conceptual relationships. They define a data lake as a repository of datasets with minimal metadata, such as attribute names and types. The paper focuses on the initial stage of dataset discovery, which involves identifying datasets that are most useful for data wrangling tasks. The authors propose a solution called D3L (Dataset Discovery in Data Lakes) that uses features of the values in a dataset to construct hash-based indexes. These indexes map the features into a uniform distance space, allowing for the measurement of relatedness between features and a target table. The approach considers various types of evidence, including attribute name similarity, attribute extent overlap, word-embedding similarity, format representation similarity, and domain distribution similarity. The authors provide a detailed description of the approach and report empirical results showing significant improvements in precision, recall, target coverage, indexing, and discovery times compared to prior work.|
|[Semantics-aware Dataset Discovery from Data Lakes with Contextualized Column-based Representation Learning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/3587136.3587146)|PVLDB 23|table union search|The document proposes Starmie, an end-to-end framework for dataset discovery from data lakes, with a focus on table union search. The framework utilizes a contrastive learning method to train column encoders from pre-trained language models, capturing rich contextual semantic information within tables. The cosine similarity between column embedding vectors is used as the column unionability score, and a filter-and-verification framework is proposed to compute the unionability score between two tables. Starmie outperforms existing solutions in the effectiveness of table union search and employs the HNSW index to accelerate query processing. The document highlights the challenges in dataset discovery and the contributions of Starmie in addressing these challenges.|
|[SANTOS: Relationship-based Semantic Table Union Search](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3588689)|SIGMOD 23|table union search|The document introduces a new approach to table search called SANTOS, which improves the accuracy of union search by considering semantic relationships between columns in a table. The document presents two methods to discover these semantic relationships: one using an existing knowledge base (KB) and the other using knowledge from the data lake itself. The authors show that SANTOS outperforms existing union search algorithms that rely on column-based semantics. They also demonstrate that a synthesized KB can improve the accuracy of union search by representing relationship semantics not found in an available KB. The document provides a new definition of unionability based on both attribute semantics and relationship semantics. The authors present their contributions, including the relationship-based semantic table union search, the KB solution, the synthesized KB solution, empirical evaluation, and benchmarks. The document also discusses related work on table union search and attribute annotation.|

|[Retrieval-Based Transformer for Table Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11843)|ACL 2023||The document introduces a novel approach to automatic data wrangling, specifically table augmentation tasks, such as row/column population and data imputation. The proposed approach is a retrieval augmented self-trained transformer model that reconstructs the original values or headers given partial tables as input. The model consists of a dense neural retrieval model and an end-to-end model for table augmentation tasks. The model is tested on the EntiTables benchmark and a new benchmark called WebTables, outperforming both supervised statistical methods and current transformer-based models. The key contributions of the paper are the introduction of the first end-to-end retrieval-based model for table augmentation, establishing a new state-of-the-art, and the creation of a new dataset for evaluation. The related work in the field is also discussed, highlighting different approaches to table augmentation tasks. The approach is based on retrieval augmented transformer models and builds on the concept of using non-parametric knowledge from an indexed corpus. The model consists of a table index, a retrieval component, and a reader or selection component. The table index is built from the training set, and the retrieval component is trained without ground truth on correct provenance. The reader component is an extractive approach, ensuring grounded predictions. The document provides a formal description of the input and ablation process for the table augmentation tasks.|
|[FakeTables: Using GANs to Generate Functional Dependency Preserving Tables with Bounded Real Data](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/287)|IJCAI 19|generate new table|The document discusses the problem of data augmentation for tabular data. The authors propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) framework called ITS-GAN to generate synthetic tables that have similar statistics as the original table and preserve the functional dependencies of a released sub-table.

|[Auto-Tables: Synthesizing Multi-Step Transformations to Relationalize Tables without Using Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14565)|VLDB 23|pre-aug/generate new table|The document discusses the problem of non-relational tables and the difficulties they pose for querying using SQL-based tools. The authors conducted a survey of real spreadsheet-tables and web-tables and found that over 30% of these tables do not conform to the relational standard. To address this issue, the authors propose the Auto-Tables system, which automatically synthesizes pipelines with multi-step transformations to transform non-relational tables into standard relational forms. The system can successfully synthesize transformations for over 70% of test cases at interactive speeds, making it an effective tool for preparing data for analytics. The document provides examples of non-relational tables and the corresponding transformations required to make them relational. The authors also highlight the challenges faced by users in manually programming these transformations and the prevalence of related questions on forums. The Auto-Tables system aims to alleviate these challenges by automating the transformation process without requiring users to provide examples.|

|[Chataug: Leveraging chatgpt for text data augmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13007v1.pdf)|arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.13007 (2023)|The document proposes a text data augmentation approach called ChatAug, which is based on the ChatGPT language model. The challenge of limited sample sizes in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, especially in few-shot learning scenarios, can be overcome by augmenting the training data. However, existing methods lack either correct labeling or diversity in the generated data. ChatAug rephrases each sentence in the training samples into multiple conceptually similar but semantically different samples using ChatGPT. The augmented samples can then be used for downstream model training. Experimental results show that ChatAug outperforms state-of-the-art text data augmentation methods in terms of testing accuracy and distribution of augmented samples. The document also discusses related work on data augmentation and few-shot learning. |
|[Data augmentation for spoken language understanding via pretrained language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13952)|arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.13952 (2020)|The document discusses a data augmentation method using pretrained language models to improve the training of spoken language understanding (SLU) models. The authors propose a semantically controlled generation approach, where a pretrained language model is used to generate synthetic training data based on dialogue acts. The method aims to increase the variability and accuracy of SLU models. Additionally, the authors address two overlooked scenarios of data scarcity in SLU: "Rich-in-Ontology" and "Rich-in-Utterance." In the Rich-in-Ontology scenario, the full ontology for the dialogue domain is given, but natural language utterances are lacking. In the Rich-in-Utterance scenario, there are abundant unlabelled utterances without annotated intents, slots, and values. The authors propose corresponding data augmentation solutions for both scenarios. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baseline systems in terms of slot tagging and intent classification accuracies on the ATIS and Snips datasets.|
